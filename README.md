# LinkedIn Clone
This is a linkedin ui clone application that I built to practice my ReactJS skills. It has some basic functionality too but I have not focused too much on that. I have mainly focused on UI elements and responsiveness.

## Functionality
1) Sign Up
2) Login
3) Dashboard with Dynamic Posts
4) Create Post (Description, Image/Video url Upload)
5) Mobile Responsive until 492px
6) Sign Out

## Tech Stack
1) ReactJS with Material UI for the Frontend
2) Redux for Global State Management
4) Firebase for Authentication, Database Storage and Web Hosting

## Run Locally
To run this project locally you need Node.js installed on your machine.
1) Clone the repo
2) Open the terminal and go inside the repo directory
3) Install all dependencies by running `npm install` (*Update dependencies as required if you encounter any errors)
4) run `npm start` to start the project locally
5) Either login with your google account or create a dummy account(*There is a bug after submitting the account creation form. Need to refresh in order to login and start testing via the dummy account)
6) Click on the *Start a post* input to create a post
7) Type in a description and you can either attach an image or a video link to your post.
8) Finally click on post to create your first post!
